      "1. **User Demand**: While there is stable user demand for the feature, the number of requests (30 over 6 months) is relatively low. This indicates that there may not be an urgent need to prioritize this feature over critical infrastructure work that the engineering team is currently focused on.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Engineering Capacity**: The engineering team is busy with critical infrastructure work, which suggests that their resources are currently allocated to more pressing projects. It may be more beneficial to wait until the team has more availability to dedicate to polishing and launching the social sharing integration feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Business Impact**: The feature is classified as a nice-to-have with no revenue dependency. Given that there is no immediate business impact tied to this feature, it may be more strategic to prioritize other revenue-generating or critical features that have a higher impact on the business.\n",
